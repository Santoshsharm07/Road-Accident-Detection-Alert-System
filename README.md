-Minimizes Response Time: Ensures prompt medical assistance by prioritizing nearby hospitals.

Features

-Real-Time Accident Detection: Utilizes YOLO for quick and accurate accident detection.

-Twilio API Integration: Sends SMS and call notifications for emergencies.

-Location Tracking: Captures and shares the exact location of the accident using GPS.

-Scalable Backend: Efficiently processes accident data and manages communication.

-User-Friendly Dashboard: Displays data and system operations for real-time monitoring.


Prerequisites

-Python 3.8 or higher

-Required Libraries: yolov5, opencv-python, pandas, numpy, flask, requests

-Twilio Account (API credentials)


Usage

-Run the application and ensure all APIs and detection models are configured.
